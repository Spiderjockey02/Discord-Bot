  Self hosting the bot
  <br>
</h1>

Want to host the bot yourself, if not [invite him](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=647203942903840779&permissions=8&scope=bot)?

>Support will only be given on errors done by the base source code. (No edits to the code.)

### Setting up server
* The system you are using to host on must have a minimum version [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14. (It will not run at all if less).
* If you are hosting the lavalink aswell on the same system, it will need [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) v17+ (v17 is preferred) and if not on the same system you will need to get the IP and port of the server. (This may require editing of application.yml)
* (Optional) You can also host the [mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) database on your system but this is optional.

### Setting up the database
The database natively used is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). So you will need to [create an account](https://www.mongodb.com/try) for this step.

* Once you have created an account navigate to the cluster page and create a free cluster.
* Next wait for the changes to be deployed (this could take upto 5 minutes) and click the `connect` button.
* Select the `Allow Access from Anywhere` button and then `Add Ip Address`.
* Create a `dbUser` and `dbUserPassword` and hold onto this for later.
* Navigate to `Choose a connection method` click `Connect your application` and copy the provided link.
* Navigate to `src/config.js` in your bot and replace the `mongodb://link`at the bottom with the link you have copied. **Make sure to replace `<password>` with the password you created** .

### Configuring the config file
Find the file `src/config.example.js`, this is where all your information will go. The links to each API is above each line, commented out.
* The API's are **highly recommended** to fill in but are optionally (If you have a missing API, the command it  to will not work.)
* `disabledCommands` & `disabledPlugins` An array of commands or categories you don't want loaded on the bot.
* `SupportServer` will match the support server for your bot.
* `websiteURL` will match your bot's dashboard, If you don't have one use `https://localhost`.
* `defaultSettings` are the settings the bot will use when in **DM's**.
* `MongoDBURl` where your MongoDB URL will go. (This is VITAL, you need it for the bot to work)
* `LavalinkNodes` where your Lavalink server information(host, port, password) go. (This is required for any type of music to be played). You can add more than one Lavalink node by adding the config line again under your current node, this helps eith ratelimiting.
* Make sure to add your bot to **the emoji [server](https://discord.gg/juFcfkVDGx)** to get access to the custom emoijis.
> Once the config is filled out rename **config.example.js** to **config.js**


### Editing bot settings
* For editing guild settings: `src/database/models/GuildSettings.js`.

### Editing the files
* Want to create your own commands?
    * There is an example of an empty command you can use to make your own command in the commands folder. (`src/commands`). **Once you have created your command make sure to place it in one of the predefined categories.**
* Added a new category, but the commands are not working?
    * You will need to add the category name to the guild's setting's plugins array. (You will need to update all guilds with this new change)


### Running the bot + Lavalink
> Run the lavalink first as lavalink can take longer to load than the bot.
* For running the lavalink, use the command: `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
* For running the bot, go to the main directory (same directory as package.json) and run command:
```sh
node .    
```
